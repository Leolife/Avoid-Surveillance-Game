# Avoid-Surveillance-Game
### Pass through each stage without getting caught by security surveillance!

In this 3rd person game, the player must go on or around obstacles by jumping, crouching, walking, or sprinting to avoid cameras.  There are stationary cameras, 
scanning cameras that pan across an area, and moving camera robots that all are there to detect the player.  If detected, the player's 
suspicion bar will fill at a rate specific to the stage, and once full you lose the game.
