# Avoid-Surveillance-Game

In progress.

**Current Goal:** To create a 3rd person game where you are escaping some sort of confinement and you must avoid cameras to not be caught.

**How it is going:** To avoid cameras, the player must go on or around obstacles by jumping, crouching, walking, or
sprinting.  I have set up stationary cameras and scanning cameras that pan across an area to detect the player.  If detected, the player's
suspicion bar will slowly fill, and once full you lose.
